# Contributing

Learn more about open source projects [here](https://opensource.guide).

## Scope

* Solves a particular problem
    * Think "Instructables," rather than a mission concept, system description, or trade study
    * e.g., printed circuit board layout files + bill of materials + assembly instructions for a modular power breakout system
* Is not just a paper on the topic
    * Papers provide context and are a great formal record of work done and its novelty, but are not the format with the least friction for reuse.
    * Projects can and should link publications and memos for context and impact!

## Prerequisites

* Open Source
    * Open source licenses encourage reuse and community contribution. Especially for code products, having a [license](https://opensource.org/licenses/) is **critical** for allowing reuse. GitHub has some information on selecting licenses (open source or not) [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository
* Terms for reuse and acknowledgment
    * Specify who should be cited in publications and how (e.g. BibTeX snippets, example citations), if applicable
    * Provide acknowledgments of support from institutions, if applicable
* Documented
    * Tells the reader what they need to know to get started, and may link to additional resources
    * e.g., don't link to a repository that has a blank `README.md` or doesn't list software dependencies

### Add items!

* [Community members can add](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) items to the list via the [pull request system](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). In this model, you are asking the maintainers to incorporate the changes you have made on your own.

### Suggest removals!

* When you think an item should be removed from the list, [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for discussion.

### Talk to others!

* When an aspect of a project linked here becomes obsolete or out-of-date, notify the maintainers of **that project**.
* If you find an item useful and iterate on it, provide your changes as feedback to the maintainers of **that project** to help improve it!
