# boss-list

**B**alloon **O**pen **S**ource **S**tuff

## What is this?

A community-curated list of resources relevant to **scientific ballooning** in all its forms.

* Points to code, how-tos, digital files, or documentation on a specific project; no files or resources are hosted or maintained here
* Lowers the barrier to entry for those conducting research, experiments, and technology development using balloon-based platforms
* Encourages reuse, providing starting points for practitioners seeking to avoid reinventing the wheel
* Enhances searchability

It follows the [awesome list](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) format. It's written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), which is human-readable in text form, and easy to write.

## What isn't it?

* Not an endorsement by the maintainers (see also this repo's [LICENSE](./LICENSE)) or any other entity or organization
* Makes no guarantee that the item is fit for purpose, or that the item will never be obsolete; only the end user can make that judgment!
* Not a place to advertise commercial products
    * Projects and guides that incorporate commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products are fine (can you imagine having to hand make every resistor and capacitor for your electronics project?), but the list item must add some additional value
