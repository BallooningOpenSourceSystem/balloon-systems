# History

This resource was conceived as a result of discussions at the 2023 Scientific Ballooning Technologies Conference, held at the University of Minnesota, May 17-19, 2023. Open source work emerged organically as a topic of mutual interest and discussion for many parties. Various formats were discussed, ranging from a webpage to a wiki. Many attendees suggested a collection of links to projects would be useful, and Paul Horton in particular suggested the awesome-list format.
